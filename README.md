# censoredFairness

This repository maintains the implementation of notions quantifying fairness and approaches migitaging unfairness in the presence of censorhip.    


D2G2 (SDM 21), a generic framework of deep generative models for interpretable dynamic graph generation. Detailded information about D2G2 is provided in [D2G2](https://github.com/vanbanTruong/vanbanTruong.github.io/blob/master/assets/SDM21.pdf). Stay tuned!  

<!--## Instructions
