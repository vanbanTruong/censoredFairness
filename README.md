# CensoredFairness

This repository provides the implementation of notions and approaches for understanding and delelopment of fairness in the presence of censorship.  

## Fairness notions in the presence of censorship
1. Concordance Imparity
2. Fair Calibration 

## Fairness algorithms in the presence of censorship

1. Fair survival forests





<!--## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the datasets as described in the Experiment/Data folder of this repository to the root folder of the project.
3. Run the code with Weka > 3.9.  
      *In Experiment folder: InstanceStreamClassifier.java and WindowStreamClassifier.java evaluate the landmark window model       and sliding window model, respectively.  
      *The FAHT folder contains the source code of the proposed FAHT.-->
